'ps' displays information about processes (by default only the processes by the current user that are running in an open terminal)

useful parameters:
-a  displays processes by all users
-x  displays also the processes that do not have a controlling terminal

example: 
ps -ax    => returns a list of all the processes running on your computer by all users
